## Roquentin's tree video presentation script

For my project, I made a generative book cover art for Jean Paul Sartre's novel Nausea. The outcome of the project is a generative image of a tree, which is emerging from the screen. The observer stares into it much in the same way Antoine Roquentin, the main character of the novel, did in its climax scene. 

Roquentin's perception of the tree is unhinged. Roots become a nameless corded mass, the trunk is covered with boiled leather, and so on. This image is detached in a similar way: It's nothing more than just circles stacked on top of one another for a 3D effect.

Gaze for a moment. How far can You detach the image from its name?
