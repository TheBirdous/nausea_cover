# Visualisation of tram sounds

## Concept
The aim of this project is to bring forth the wide array of mechanical sounds of a tram, which we can hear from its inside (the humming of the drivetrain and the motors, the sound produced by rail links, as well as the signal sounds used to warn cars or passengers). This is to be achieved with a visualisation based on a red or green glowing dot-matrix display typical of Czech trams. The display and the dots within it could be abstractly modeled, and then distorted or moved in various ways in reaction to the sound. Perhaps some inspiration in movement could be taken in Fishinger's Optical Poem?

## Keywords
amplification, antihumanism, anachronism, reconstruction, comfort

## Generative?
This work is conceived as audio-reactive, therefore audio input is responsible for its generative aspect.

## Presentation
Ideally in a special tram with a screen and a microphone, perhaps even an ambient musician. The tram would depart at night time, people would be seated, and together would watch the visualisation based on sound picked up by a microphone in real time. 

I'm aware, that arranging this is not at all simple, so a more realistic option is to fallback to pre-recorded sounds in an enclosed environment (a projection room perhaps). But that kind of takes a lot of the concept away...

## Interaction
Machine with a machine, the human is a mere spectator at this stage.    

## Technology
p5.js, as I probably feel most comfortable with it.

## Inspiration
We are about two centuries away from the sensations of the first railway travellers, who experienced first hand, the speed and ruthlesness of modernity. Of course, my work does not aim to reproduce the "railway spine" (a sickness observed in passengers involved in railroad accidents of the time) in anyone. Instead, the idea behind this work, is to bring forth and intensify the space, which a tram offers to a post-modern traveller hardly (psychologically) moved by almost 200 year old technology. For me atleast, this enclosure in a machine offers rather a certain comfort, endemic to railway transportation. More particularly, I find trams to be most profound among the modes of transport in offering this experience. Cars, buses, and planes are too "noisy" in their sound, there is nothing to listen to, the cars of a train are often soundproofed, and when not, only the rhytmical sound of the rail joints can be discerned, and in a metro the high-pitched reverbs are almost anxiety inducing. This is not the case on especially an old tram, where humming of the motors right below us, signalization sounds, and rhytmical passing over rail joints together create in my view a pleasant, but layered and complex sound, which if I'm lucky to catch undisturbed, captures my attention.

## Problems
The tram installation is not easily conceivable, it's a bit of a far shot.

I'm not using professional equipment to record the sounds, and therefore am not sure if I'll be able to record the sounds such that they could provide for a diverse and interesting visualisation. If not, I may have to completely change the project.

I don't have any experience working with sound, and that could result in a lot of time spent on sound editing.

Is it okay if I change the project for a completely different one if I find out, that I can't gather a good sound base? I'd like to record the sounds at the beginning of next week, so I would
