# Visualisation of tram sounds

## Concept
The aim of this project is to bring forth the wide array of mechanical sounds of a tram, which we can hear from its inside (the humming of the drivetrain and the motors, the sound produced by rail links, as well as the signal sounds used to warn cars or passengers). This is to be achieved with a visualisation based on a red or green glowing dot-matrix display typical of Czech trams. The display and the dots within it could be abstractly modeled, and then distorted or moved in various ways in reaction to the sound.

## Keywords
amplification, antihumanism, anachronism, reconstruction, comfort

## Generative?
This work is conceived as audio-reactive, therefore audio input is responsible for its generative aspect.

## Presentation
Ideally in a special tram with a screen and a microphone, perhaps even an ambient musician. The tram would depart at night time, people would be seated, and together would watch the visualisation based on sound picked up by a microphone in real time. 

I'm aware, that arranging this is not at all simple, so a more realistic option is to fallback to pre-recorded sounds in an enclosed environment (a projection room perhaps). But that kind of takes a lot of the concept away...

## Interaction
Machine with a machine, the human is a mere spectator at this stage.    

## Technology
p5.js, as I probably feel most comfortable with it.

## Inspiration
The idea behind this work is to bring forth and intensify the space, which a tram offers to a post-modern traveller hardly (psychologically) moved by almost 200 year old technology. This space is especially profound on an old tram, where humming of the motors right below us, signalization sounds, and rhytmical passing over rail joints together create in my view a pleasant, but layered and complex sound, which if I'm lucky to catch undisturbed, captures my attention.
