# Illustrated Spinoza

## Concept
The aim of this project is to illustrate some of Spinoza's theorems from The Ethics, with the intent of making his metaphysical ideas more accessible and thought-provoking. The resulting illustrations could be integrated into an online text, either an online edition of the book, or an encyclopedia entry.

## Keywords
metaphysics, illustration, Spinoza, philosophy, accessibility

## Generative?
The illustration is conceived as dynamic. The generative behaviour will be based on Spinoza's dynamic ontology. The illustrations should communicate a constant flux, and bring forward our own desire to affect and conceive it. 

## Presentation
Together with citations from Spinoza's The Ethics, or from secondary literature.

## Interaction 
Interaction with mouse and keyboard would nicely supplement 

## Technology
p5.js
