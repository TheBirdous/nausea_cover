# A generative book cover art for Sartre's Nausea

## Concept
The goal of this project is to create a series of generated book cover artworks for J. P. Sartre's novel Nausea. The artworks will be inspired by a scene in the novel, where the main character sits on a park bench and as he loses his grip on signification, ponders the superfluity and randomness of the tree in front of him: "The chestnut tree pressed itself against my eyes. Green rust covered it half way up; the bark, black and blistered, looked like boiled leather". The resulting series of artworks should capture the dizzying decay of signifiance and profound randomness of objects as they finally occupy our whole field of view. I am not sure if my level of technical skill lets me, but I would like to intensify the superfluity of the object by incporporating it into a sparse 3D scene, something akin to Dali's Elephants or De Chirico's The Grand Metaphysician. I will need to think about good composition for sure...

## Keywords
Nausea, Sartre, surrealism, tree, psychedelia 

## Generative?
The artworks will mainly differ in the distortion of the tree, which is a central aspect of the artwork, for that I will use a noise function.

## Presentation
I would present it either on its own, or as a part of a finished book cover that I would create. I would definitely like to do the whole cover if time lets me, but I want to focus on the artwork first. Either way, the presentation would be on a screen, probably with an attached excerpt from Sartre's novel.

## Interaction 
I don't think I can reasonably incorporate interaction into this concept.

## Technology
p5.js, or maybe Blender

## Inspiration
