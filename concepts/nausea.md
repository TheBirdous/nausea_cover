# A generative book cover art for Sartre's Nausea

## Concept
The goal of this project is to create a series of generated book cover artworks for J. P. Sartre's novel Nausea. The artworks are inspired by a scene in the novel, where the main character sits on a park bench and as he loses his grip on signification, ponders the superfluity and randomness of the tree in front of him: "The chestnut tree pressed itself against my eyes. Green rust covered it half way up; the bark, black and blistered, looked like boiled leather". The resulting series of artworks should capture the dizzying decay of signifiance and profound randomness of objects as they finally occupy our whole field of view.

## Inspiration

Nausea’s very subject is the randomness, the contingency, the superfluity, of the world; where better to begin than with Roquentin’s own randomness, his contingency as an invented character?

Roquentin’s life has become negatively structured by randomness, for he knows that it has become impossible to choose one course of action over another, and he is immobilized by it.

I was sitting, slightly bent, my head bowed, alone in front of that black, knotty mass, which was utterly crude and frightened me.

The chestnut tree pressed itself against my eyes. Green rust covered it half way up; the bark, black and blistered, looked like boiled leather.

If you existed, you had to exist to that extent, to the point of mildew, blisters, obscenity. In another world, circles and melodies kept their pure and rigid lines. But existence is a curve. Trees, midnight-blue pillars, the happy bubbling of a fountain, living smells, wisps of heat haze floating in the cold air, a red-haired man digesting on a bench: all these somnolences, all these digestions taken together had a vaguely comic side.

But a circle doesn’t exist either. That root, on the other hand, existed in so far that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it fascinated me, filled my eyes, repeatedly brought me back to its own existence. It was no use my repeating: ‘It is a root’ – that didn’t work any more. I saw clearly that you could not pass from its function as a root, as a suction-pump, to that, to that hard, compact sea-lion skin, to that oily, horny, stubborn look. The function explained nothing; it enabled you to understand in general what a root was, but not that one at all. That root, with its colour, its shape, its frozen movement, was … beneath all explanation.
